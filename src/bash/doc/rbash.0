       If bbaasshh is started with the name rrbbaasshh, or the --rr option is supplied at
       invocation,  the  shell becomes _r_e_s_t_r_i_c_t_e_d.  A restricted shell is used
       to set up an environment more controlled than the standard  shell.   It
       behaves  identically  to bbaasshh with the exception that the following are
       disallowed or not performed:

       +o      Changing directories with ccdd.

       +o      Setting or unsetting the values of SSHHEELLLL, PPAATTHH,  HHIISSTTFFIILLEE,  EENNVV,
              or BBAASSHH__EENNVV.

       +o      Specifying command names containing //.

       +o      Specifying  a  filename  containing  a // as an argument to the ..
              builtin command.

       +o      Using the --pp option to the  ..   builtin  command  to  specify  a
              search path.

       +o      Specifying  a  filename containing a slash as an argument to the
              hhiissttoorryy builtin command.

       +o      Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument  to  the
              --pp option to the hhaasshh builtin command.

       +o      Importing  function  definitions  from  the shell environment at
              startup.

       +o      Parsing the values of BBAASSHHOOPPTTSS and SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS from the shell  en-
              vironment at startup.

       +o      Redirecting  output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirec-
              tion operators.

       +o      Using the eexxeecc builtin command to replace the shell with another
              command.

       +o      Adding or deleting builtin commands with the --ff and  --dd  options
              to the eennaabbllee builtin command.

       +o      Using  the  eennaabbllee  builtin  command  to  enable  disabled shell
              builtins.

       +o      Specifying the --pp option to the ccoommmmaanndd builtin command.

       +o      Turning off  restricted  mode  with  sseett  ++rr  or  sshhoopptt  --uu  rree--
              ssttrriicctteedd__sshheellll.

       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

       When  a  command  that is found to be a shell script is executed, rrbbaasshh
       turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
